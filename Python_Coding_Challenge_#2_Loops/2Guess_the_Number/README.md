# Guess the Number

# Intent
This program generates a random number between 1 and 10 and keeps asking the user to guess it until they get it right.

# Pseudo Code
1. Generate a random number using `random.randint(1, 10)`.
2. Enter a `while` loop where the user keeps guessing.
3. If the guess is correct, print "Correct!" and break the loop.
4. If the guess is incorrect, ask the user to try again.
